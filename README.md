# Student-Evaluation-System-
This project in based on python and MySQL connector
AIM:The aim of this computer project is to develop an interactive student performance evaluation system. This system will allow users to input a student's name and retrieve their academic and co-curricular activity data from a MySQL database. The data will then be visually represented through subject-wise bar graphs, allowing for easy assessment of a student's performance in various subjects across multiple tests. Additionally, a pie chart will depict the distribution of marks in co-curricular activities.

RESEARCH FINDING: As per research, the problem of effectivea large number of teaching data resources is time and energyconsuming.Thissynopsis puts forward an optimization method of student management evaluation system under the background of big data. Assess the efficiency of data retrieval from the MySQL database. Findings may include the system's ability to seamlessly connect to the database, retrieve accurate data, and handle errors gracefully.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:
User Interface: The project includes the development of a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users, such as teachers or administrators, to interact with the system.
Data Retrieval: The system will connect to a MySQL database to retrieve student performance data, including academic marks in Physics, Chemistry, and Maths, and co-curricular activity marks in Sports, Dance, Music, and Arts.

Data Visualization: The project will visualize the retrieved data using bar graphs for each subject (Physics, Chemistry, Maths) and pie charts for co-curricular activities. The bar graphs will represent test-wise marks, and the pie chart will display the distribution of marks in co-curricular activities.
Subject-Wise Analysis: The system will provide the ability to analyze student performance in Physics, Chemistry, and Maths across various tests (UT-1, UT-2, MID, FINAL).
Co-curricular Analysis: It will enable the assessment of student performance in co-curricular activities, providing insights into the distribution of marks in Sports, Dance, Music, and Arts.
Scalability: The system should be adaptable and scalable to handle data for multiple students and accommodate additional subjects, tests, and co-curricular activities.
